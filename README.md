# 📚 Assignment

## ✅ Week 6 — IPC, Process Synchronization & Shared Memory
Topics Covered: Mutex Locks, Semaphores, Producer-Consumer, Shared Memory
Session
Description
Source Code
Output
## Session 1
Mutex Lock Demonstration
session1_mutex.c

## Session 2
Producer-Consumer Simulation
session2_prodcon.c

## Session 3
Semaphore Implementation in C
session3_semaphore.c

## Session 4
Shared Memory Programming
session4_shm.c

# Key concepts covered:
Mutual exclusion using pthread_mutex_lock/unlock
Producer-Consumer problem using POSIX semaphores (sem_wait, sem_post)
Binary vs Counting semaphores
Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using shmget, shmat, shmdt, shmctl
Race conditions and how to eliminate them

# 🛠️ How to Compile & Run
All programs are written in C and tested on Linux (Ubuntu).
Requires gcc with pthread support.
